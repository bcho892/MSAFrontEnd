# Welcome to my MSA Front End App - ChakMovies

[Link to Website](https://bcho892.github.io/MSAFrontEnd/)

This is a web app that accesses the MoviesDatabase API and then uses it to both display currently popular movies, as well as allowing users to search for movies and access details about them. I have incorporated ChakraUI into this app, and that made it super easy for me to also implement a dark/light theme as an extra feature.

For phase 3 I shifted the focus of improving both the experience and interface of the app, which is what I believe to be the most important part of Front-End development while also integrating good/interesting development practices such as testing, deployment, and utilizing my own backend.

Can run with classic `npm start` or view by going to the link above :)

## Phase 3 Specifics
The advanced features I've attempted:
* UI Scaliablity
* Mobile First Development
* Unit Testing
* Fluid Transition
* API connection to own cloud hosted API

Unsure, but still attempted:
* YAML CI/CD Pipeline
* PWA Functionality

## What did I learn
From undertaking this assignment the main takeaway was the importance of writing scalable and readble code so that it can be easily extended in the future, which initially served as a challenge for me at the start because a good amount of time was spent trying to refactor existing code. This also brought to my attention how useful test driven development was, as it put a main focus on the functionality and therefore gives a clear goal to work towards to which in the long term saves a good amount of time.
